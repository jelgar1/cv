## Jonathan Gardiner

I'm an enthusiastic and code passionate recent Makers Academy graduate, looking for a developer position. After gaining an MSc in International Business Management, I had a successful career as a data driven digital marketer working in Montpellier, France and London, primarily for tech startups. Having finished Makers Academy, a 12 week coding bootcamp, I'm currently looking for my first developer role, in a team environment in which I can learn quickly and contribute early on.

## Skills

#### Communication and Presenting

I'm comfortable presenting to groups of people and getting my ideas and information across succinctly.

- In my role as Marketing Manager at Brainient I'd present monthly marketing updates to all other employees (around 50) at the company.

- At BIME Analytics I built marketing dashboards and communicated with our CEO so she could then present out company marketing performance to the board of investors. I was also responsible for the customer reference program which would involve constantly liaising with our customers.

- I presented our final project (Politify) to a room of a few hundred people and even managed a few laughs (with me, not at me!).

#### Comfortable in challenging situations
I can quickly adapt to challenging situations and like taking risks and constantly challenging and improving myself.

- For my first full time job at BIME Analytics I moved to Montpellier in the south of France. I barely knew the language, I didn't know anyone in the city and it was a completely new industry for me. I ended up staying for a fantastic 2 years. While I was there the number of free trial signups more than doubled and web traffic increased by over 50%.

- At Makers Academy we're challenged with new technologies each week. I've continued this approach after the course recently looking into Sass.

####Â Organisation
Especially in my previous career, I've had a lot of responsibility for organising projects and events.
- At Brainient I organised our stand and attendance at DMEXCO, Europe's largest digital marketing conference. I was also in charge of organising our own quarterly event for around 200 clients, press and potential customers.
- Every month at BIME Analytics, I was in charge of sending the company newsletter. It always needed a large amount of input from upper management, who were often busy and traveling. Throughout my time there it was sent off on time and to very high standards.
- Completed our Makers Academy final project. We had a hard deadline of 2 weeks so daily stand-ups, retrospectives and good organisation was essential.
